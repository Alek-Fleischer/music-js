Music-js is a music visualization program that includes many built-in
customization options for a playlist of music. Provided links to
MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and/or WebM sound files, it can create a real-time
visualization of the music as it plays, using the HTML5 Audio API.

This application supports visualization of external sound files,
enabling this to easily become a plugin for other sites.

Documentation will be added in another update. For now, refer to the
JSON object in ``index.html`` under ``/static`` for a demonstration
of customizable attributes.
